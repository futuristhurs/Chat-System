Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built in Java using the socket programming API. The application consists of a server and a client component that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time.


Installation

To run the chat application, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the official website.
Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

'git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git'


Usage

To use the chat application, you will need to start the server component first. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Then, run the following command to start the server:

'java Server'

This will start the chat server on port 8000.
Next, you can start the client component by running the following command in a separate terminal window:

'java Client'

This will open the chat application window, where you can enter your username and start sending and receiving messages in real-time.
